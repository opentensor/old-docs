## [overview]

Bittensor is a mining network, similar to Bitcoin, that offers censorship-resistant access to a decentralized network of machine learning models. By leveraging digital incentives and rewarding participants directly for their contributions of computational resources, expertise and innovation, Bittensor establishes a comprehensive, open-source ecosystem of artificial intelligence competencies. The native currency, TAO, constitutes both reward and access token to the network.

This documentation covers the three primary ways that users can interact with Bittensor: mining, validating, and through the API as a client.
