## [triumvirate]

The Triumvirate has three seats which are filled by Opentensor Foundation members, and is the party responsible for creating and executing proposals. Triumvirate members are not elected, but they have no voting power on the proposals they create. The [Senate](governance/senate) is the party responsible for whether or not the proposal should be included into the network.
