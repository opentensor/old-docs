## [governance]


Bittensor's governance protocol transitions network management from centralization within the foundation to community-ownership over time. The first stage of this management decentralization creates a bicameral legislature, in which the [Triumvirate](glossary/glossary#triumvirate) creates proposals for the [Senate](governance/senate) to approve or veto. Triumvirate members are Opentensor Foundation employees, while the Senate is formed from the top K delegate hotkeys.

### _proposals

Proposals are encapsulations of other extrinsics, which will only be executed after meeting two conditions:

1. Has obtained 50% + 1 approvals from the Senate
2. Has been closed by a member of the Triumvirate

This guarantees that Senate has to come to a majority consensus in order for a proposal to be executed. When a proposal is executed, the calldata that was passed to it during it's creation is then included in the same block as the close extrinsic.

### _security

Previous to the governance protocol, all administrative actions within the network (e.g. changing hyperparameters, creating new sub-networks, chain upgrades) were permissioned via a single privileged key, known as `sudo`. If the `sudo` private key were somehow compromised, a malicious actor could take over the network and execute any privileged extrinsics. With the governance protocol, a malicious actor would have to compromise a Triumvirate member, along with controlling a majority of Senate seats in order to approve a proposal.

### _end-to-end example

The Triumvirate contains three seats with members `Alice`, `Bob`, and `Charlie`, and the Senate has three members elected to participate named `Dave`, `Eve`, and `Ferdie`.

`Bob` has a novel concept for a sub-network, and wishes to deploy it on the Bittensor network. `Bob` creates a proposal with the calldata `SubtensorModule.SudoAddNetwork(netuid, tempo, modality)`, and sends the transaction to the network in order to broadcast the proposal.

`Dave`, `Eve`, and `Ferdie` all own nominated delegate hotkeys, all of which individually control greater than two percent of all total stake in the network. Using `btcli`, they are able to view the proposal and the calldata which it will execute upon approval. `Dave` and `Ferdie` decide that they wish to approve this new sub-network and both approve the proposal. `Eve` disagrees with the concept, and decides to disapprove of the proposal.

Even though the Senate may hold twelve members at any time, it is not a guarantee that there will be twelve occupied seats. The approval threshold with a Senate size of three will be two approvals. Since `Dave` and `Ferdie` both approved of this proposal, it is now able to be executed by a member of the Triumvirate.

`Alice` sees that the proposal has been passed by the Senate, and executes the `close` extrinsic in order to execute the calldata within the proposal.

Bittensor now has a new sub-network which `Alice`, `Bob`, or `Charlie` can create further proposals in order to change hyperparameters, allow/disallow registration, and any other configuration which was prevously controlled by the sudo pallet.
