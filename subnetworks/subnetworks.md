## [subnetworks]

Bittensor runs multiple self-contained economic markets incentivizing access to different forms of machine intelligence, for instance; subnetwork 1 produces completions from text prompts and subnetwork 2 incentivizes the production of informationally dense embeddings from text. These economic domains are called "subnetworks".


### _viewing subnetworks

You can uses **btcli list_subnets** to show all currently running subnetworks on bittensor.
```bash dark
$ btcli subnets list
NETUID  NEURONS  MAX_N   DIFFICULTY  TEMPO  CON_REQ  EMISSION  BURN(τ)
1       691    1.02 K   198.08 T    99     None     28.44%   τ4.75710
3      4096    4.10 K   320.81 T    99     None     71.56%   τ1.00000
2      5120

    Description:
        NEURONS: Current UID count.
        MAX_N: Max UID count.
        DIFFICULTY: Proof of work registration difficulty.
        TEMPO: Blocks between network emission distribution.
        CON_REQ: Network requirement
        EMISSION: Percentage of global emission emitted into this network each block.
        BURN: TAO recycle cost per registration.
```

### _viewing state

To extract more fine grained information about each subnetwork use **bt.metagraph**.
```python numbered dark
import bittensor as bt
subnet = bt.metagraph( netuid = 1 )             # Get the current state.
assert subnet.netuid == 1
subnet.sync( block = 101010 )                   # Sync the state with a particular block.
assert subnet.block == 101010
```

Subnetwork are composed of a discrete number of "uids" under which validators and miners position themselves and over which Yuma Consensus is run.
```python numbered dark
import bittensor as bt
subnet = bt.metagraph( netuid = 1 )
assert subnet.uids.tolist() == [ 0, 1, 2, ... 1022, 1023 ]
```

Each uid in the network belongs to a unique **hotkey** which in turn is connected to a unique **coldkey** which a miner has used to register with.
```python numbered dark
import bittensor as bt
subnet = bt.metagraph( netuid = 1 )
uid = 123
print ('uid', uid, ' owned by hotkey:', subnet.hotkeys[ uid ], 'assoicated with coldkey': subnet.coldkey[ uid ] )
```

### _viewing parameters

Through [registration](subnetworks/registration) hotkeys cycle in and out of each subnetwork depending on their performance according to subnetworks [validators](validating/validating). Stake **metagraph.S** across subnetwork is universal. This validation method is performed by validators setting a set of weights **metagraph.W** on the chain based on their subjective valuations of the miners across the network.

```python numbered dark
import bittensor as bt
subnet = bt.metagraph( netuid = 1, lite = False)
print ('subnet 1 validator stake', subnet.S )
print ('subnet 1 validator weights', subnet.W )
```
Correctly assessing the value of the miners on the network is incentivized by the chain which distributes bonds **metagraph.B**, which pick up part of the inflation from those miners as dividends **metagraph.D**.
```python numbered dark
import bittensor as bt
subnet = bt.metagraph( netuid = 1 )
print ('subnet 1 validator dividends', subnet.D )
```
