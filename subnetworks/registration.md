## [registration]

Prior to mining TAO, miners must attain a UID slot within one of Bittensor's sub-networks via a competition. This step is called registration. At the time of writing, there are 1024 UIDs available on Subnetwork 1 and 4096 on Subnetwork 3.

```bash dark
uids
    netuid 1: [ 0, 1, 2, ... 1022, 1023 ]
    netuid 3: [ 0, 1, 2, ... 4094, 4095 ]
```

There are two methods of registrations:

1. Proof-of-Work registration

      ```bash dark
      btcli subnet register --netuid SELECTED_NETUID --wallet.name YOUR_COLDKEY --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY
      ```

2. TAO Recycle Registration

      ```bash dark
      btcli subnet recycle_register --netuid SELECTED_NETUID --wallet.name YOUR_COLDKEY --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY
      ```

Once the registration cost has been paid, the miner enters the network by replacing an older underperforming miner and can now [mine](mining/mining) themselves from that slot.


### _pow

Proof-of-Work (POW) registrations require miners to solve a SHA256 hashing problem before winning a UID. This route is recommmended for miners contributing raw compute power to Bittensor or don't have a previous token supply.
```bash dark
btcli subnet register
      --netuid SUBNETWORK_NETUID_TARGET
      --wallet.name YOUR_COLDKEY_NAME
      --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY_NAME
```
!> Coldkeys
The POW registration does not requires only your `coldkeypub.txt` and `hotkey`. It is also possible to sign the registration extrinsic payload by a separate key.


### _recycle registration

Recycle registrations allow a miner to recycle TAO back into the inflation mechanism (to be passed through the incentive mechanism at a later date) in exchange for a UID on a subnetwork. Recycle registrations cost TAO to execute but takes less time to activate than POW registration. They recommended for miners seeking to attain slots quickly and who already have a small amount of TAO at their disposal.
```bash dark
btcli subnet recycle_register
      --netuid SELECTED_NETUID
      --wallet.name YOUR_COLDKEY
      --wallet.hotkey YOUR_HOTKEY
```


### _cubit

It is highly recommended that you use a Nvidia GPU to register for a faster hash rate. To use your GPU during the hashing problem you must [install Cubit](https://github.com/opentensor/cubit).

```bash dark
python3 -m pip install bittensor[cubit]
```

Once installed you can specify which GPU you are running your registration over or `--all` of them.
```bash dark
btcli subnet register
      --cuda
      --all
```


### _cost updates

POW and the recycle regsistration cost are mutually adaptive, updating their costs on an `adjustment interval` so that the number of registrations over that interval remain constanct, i.e. 3 registrations per 100 blocks. Below is pseudo code for the update conditions.
```python numbered dark title=subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/block_step link=https://github.com/opentensor/subtensor/pallets/subtensor/src/block_step.rs
if regs > target and recycle_regs > pow_regs:
      burn_cost *= ( n_burn_regs + target_regs ) / (2 * target_regs)

elif regs > target and recycle_regs <= pow_regs:
      pow_difficulty *= ( n_pow_regs + target_regs ) / (2 * target_regs)

elif regs <= target and recycle_regs > pow_regs:
      burn_difficulty *= ( n_burn_regs + target_regs ) / (2 * target_regs)

elif regs <= target and recycle_regs <= pow_regs:
      pow_difficulty *= ( n_pow_regs + target_regs ) / (2 * target_regs)
```

To view the current subnetwork difficulty on each subnet run `btcli subnets list`
```bash dark
btcli subnets list
NETUID  NEURONS  MAX_N   DIFFICULTY  TEMPO  CON_REQ  EMISSION  BURN(τ)
1       691    1.02 K   198.08 T    99     None     28.44%   τ4.75710
3      4096    4.10 K   320.81 T    99     None     71.56%   τ1.00000
    DIFFICULTY: Current proof of work difficulty
    BURN: Current cost to register a key via recycle registration.
```


### _inspecting uids

Once a slot has been attained you can view the performance of you registered wallet you can run ```btcli wallet overview --netuid```.

### _difficulty adjustment 

The POW and Recycle difficulties are adaptively adjusted every 100 blocks based on the following 4 cases.


    1. Registrations exceed the target and there were more recycle registrations than pow registrations?
        `burn_cost = burn_cost * ( burn_regs_this_interval + target_regs ) / 2 * target_regs`

    2. Registrations exceed the target and there were not more recycle registrations than pow registrations?
        `pow_difficulty = pow_difficulty * ( pow_regs_this_interval + target_regs ) / 2 * target_regs`

    3. Registrations do not exceed the target and there were more recycle registrations than pow registrations?
        `burn_difficulty = pow_difficulty * ( regs_this_interval + target_regs ) / 2 * target_regs`

    4. Registrations do not exceed the target and there were not more recycle registrations than pow registrations?
        `pow_difficulty = pow_difficulty * ( regs_this_interval + target_regs ) / 2 * target_regs`


### _viewing difficulty

Using the cli
```bash dark
btcli subnets list
NETUID  NEURONS  MAX_N   DIFFICULTY  TEMPO  CON_REQ  EMISSION  BURN(τ)
1       691    1.02 K   198.08 T    99     None     28.44%   τ4.75710
3      4096    4.10 K   320.81 T    99     None     71.56%   τ1.00000
    DIFFICULTY: Current proof of work difficulty
    BURN: Current cost to register a key via recycle registration.
