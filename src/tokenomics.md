# Taonomics

Bittensor “fair launched” (no tokens were pre-mined) in 2021. The supply of Tao is 21,000,000, and there is a halving cycle such that for every 10.5 million blocks, rewards per block halve. Currently, every 12 seconds (one blockstep), a single Tao emits into the network. There will be 64 halving events, with the first occurring in August 2025. Follow this [link](https://explorer.nakamoto.opentensor.ai/#/explorer) to view the current supply and block number.
