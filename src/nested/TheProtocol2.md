# The Protocol

Finney, our main network, is composed of two types of nodes: Servers and Validators. Servers are prompted for information by Validators and given assessments based on the value of their responses. These assessments are then relayed to the network blockchain, Subtensor, where TAO is distributed in proportion. The network runs as per our consensus mechanism such that the most valuable nodes are rewarded with the most stake (TAO), while low-value nodes become weakened to the point of de-registration.
