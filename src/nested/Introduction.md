# Introduction

Bittensor is a protocol that powers a scalable, open-source, and decentralized neural network. By integrating blockchain and machine learning technology, the system is designed to streamline and incentivize the production of artificial intelligence.

*We are, effectively, creating a market for machine intelligence: commodifying mathematical representations of insight gained through data and building an infrastructure to support this.*
